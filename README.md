Investigate what I can do with Jupyter.
You can check working notebooks by [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hamasho/jupyter-apps/master).

## Apps

### Map/Spreadsheet Interactive Update

In this notebook, you can edit the spreadsheet and redraw the map
1. Change the content (LAT or LNG) of the sheet (ex. Fabbit Otemach's LAT 35.585 -> 35.500)
2. Redraw the map
3. Check the point is moved
